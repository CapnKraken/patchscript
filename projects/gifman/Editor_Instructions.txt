The editor was just there so I could make the levels quickly.
It's not a super usable tool.

However, if you want to use it, this is how:

Up/Down arrows: select a level (number at top right)

1: Save a file called "ln.txt" with n=level number (This will overwrite anything already there so be careful)
2: Load the level represented by the level number (if it exists)

Q: Eraser (click an item to delete it)
W: Platform (click twice to draw a platform)
E: Player Spawn Point (there has to be one of these, and there can only be one)
R: Goal Flag (like the spawnpoint, there can only be one)
T: Coin (collect these to unlock the goal flag)
Y: Large Enemy (static, or made to move using an enemy director object)
U: Small Enemy (stays still until you get close to it, then moves towards you)
I: Large Spike (simple spike obstacle)
O: Small Spike (smaller spike obstacle)

Left/Right arrows: rotate the spike objects by 90 degrees

P: Enemy Director (direct the motion of the large enemies)
	This one deserves some explanation. If a large enemy is touching an enemy director when it spawns in,
	It will move in the opposite direction of the collision until it touches another enemy director.
	Then, it will turn 180 degrees, ping-ponging between the two director objects.
	This object is invisible during gameplay.
