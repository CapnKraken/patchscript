Patch uses a three-tiered system for variables.

1. Globals (or "globs")
    Accessible by every script running in the project.
    Created/Modified using "setglob".

setglob global_var_name <>


2. Attributes (object-local)
    Accessible by every script running in the object the attribute belongs to.
    Objects are instantiated with default attributes, and more can be defined in their scripts.
    Created/Modified using "setattribute".

setattribute object_local_var_name <>

3. Variables (script-local)
    Accessible only in the script which defines them.
    Multiple instances of a script will have independent versions of local variables.
    These are the default kind of variable.
    Created/Modified using "setvar".

setvar local_var_name <>

SET 

"set" is a general-purpose variable modifier command.
If there is a variable, attribute, or global called "count", for instance, it can be modified like:

set count 5

"set" can also increment values.

set count ++
set count -= 5
set count *= 5

...and so on
Modifiers are:
    ++
    --
    +=
    -=
    *=
    /=  (floating-point division)
    //= (integer division)
