Hats are the commands at the top of a script.

Possible hats:
Start
Receive "message"
Trap
Label my_label

Start:
The most basic one.
A script with 'Start' at the top will begin execution the frame the object is spawned in.

Receive "message":
Starts a script when a specified message (which must be a string, in quotes) is received from another sprite.
When this script starts, the local variable "_message_data" contains any data sent with the message.
For more, see Events.

Trap:
That is, trap error. This is how error handling is currently done.
If an error occurs in any of the object's scripts, that script will terminate and all scripts
starting with "Trap" will begin execution.
In the new script, a local variable called "_error_type" will be created, storing the type of error.

Label my_label:
This often serves as a hat but doesn't have to- it can be in the middle of scripts too.
It saves a location (line number) in the code in an attribute (my_label is the variable name in this case)
Execution can be started at the label with "fork" or "jump" (see Branching)

End:
Ends execution of a script.
I generally put one at the end of every script just in case.
Even if it's not necessary, like after an infinite loop, ha.
