This is a simple game meant to demonstrate how Patch works when you're just starting.
The scripts are heavily commented so I'd recommend taking a look inside.

Controls:
Arrows      - move tank
Z           - shoot cannon
Left Shift  - lock turret rotation
Escape      - quit game

Try your hand at extending this project too, if you like.
Maybe add a title screen, score saving, different enemies, etc?
