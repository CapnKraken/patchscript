TODO
    Saving a canvas should allow you to specify coordinates.
    Better error detection/handling. Preferably it would never throw any python exceptions, just patchscript ones.
    Web version, which you can run in a browser. I am not sure how the file structures would work with that.

Maybe
    Use opengl for drawing to speed that up, use shaders for per-pixel edits like color shifting.
    Implement Patchscript in C or C++ using SDL and/or opengl for better performance.

Bugs
    Sometimes pausing the game will crash Patchscript (infinite loop somewhere?). Seems random and rare.
        The bug does not occur when not using busy wait in my experience.
    _transform_children does not work entirely properly- updating transform cause some previous transfomations to be cancelled (_width for example).
